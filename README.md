# CodeAlpha_Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on web-scraped quotes using Python and TextBlob. It classifies quotes as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on polarity scores, stores the results in a Pandas DataFrame, and visualizes sentiment distribution using a pie chart. A simple example of combining NLP and data visualization.
